                    <p>I grew up in Camilla, Georgia. In 3rd grade, I discovered a passion for technology that never stopped growing.
                        I graduated from Pelham High School and began pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University.
                        For the past two years, I've been tutoring my underclassmen in programming concepts as I've strived to develop my own skills.
                        Graduating in December, 2025, I'm looking forward to new opportunities to improve people's lives with technology.
                        <br><br>
                        I recently lost my mother, who hated computers and the internet as much as I loved them. Before she passed, I promised her that I'd use my talents
                        to help others with my talents. Even now, my desire to fulfill my promise continues to burn brightly.
                        <br><br>
                        My personal life includes a love of sports, cooking, driving, and my girlfriend of 3 years. I reside in the Metro-Atlanta area
                        where I'm surrounded by potential. Depicted is my first snow day, at the KSU's Marietta Campus.
